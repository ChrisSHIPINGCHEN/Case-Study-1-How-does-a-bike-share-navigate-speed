Scenario

I are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

About the company

Cyclistic, launched in 2016, is a thriving bike-share company in Chicago with a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles across 692 stations, offering flexibility in transportation by allowing bikes to be picked up from and returned to any station in the network. The company has historically marketed to a broad audience with various pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, distinguishing customers as either casual riders or members. Financial analysis shows that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. Recognizing this, the company aims to focus its marketing efforts on converting casual riders into annual members by leveraging their existing familiarity and preference for Cyclistic's services. The leadership, led by Moreno, plans to dive into historical data to understand the differences between casual riders and members, exploring motivations for membership purchase and how digital media could influence marketing strategies to drive this conversion.

Step 1: Ask

The questions that need to be answered are:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Step 2: Prepare

I will be using the public dataset loacted [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. And I will downloaded data files from January 2023 to December 2023. 

Because we need to clean the data files with one years so the we need merge 12 data files together. 

Read the trip data from 202301 to 202312 (12 months)
